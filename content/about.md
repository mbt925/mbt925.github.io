My name is **Mohsen Biglari**. I am <span id="age"> years, day(s) and second(s)</span> old. This is my personal blog where you can you find some posts about programming and software development. I'll be happy to hear about your ideas and feedbacks.

I love programming, and I have some experiences with some programming languages like VB6, C, C++, Java, C#\.Net, VB.Net, MATLAB, Python, Java Mobile, iOS (Objective-C, Swift), and Android (Java, Kotlin). I am mainly an Android developer, and I do basic web programming just for personal purposes. You can have a look at my last projects from [here](/allprojects).
