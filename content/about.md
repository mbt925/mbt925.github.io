My name is **Mohsen Biglari**. I am <span id="age"> years, day(s) and second(s)</span> old. This is my personal blog where you can you find some posts about programming and software development. I'll be happy to hear about your ideas and feedbacks.

I love programming, and I have some experiences with some programming languages like VB6, C, C++, Java, C#\.Net, VB.Net, MATLAB, Python, Java Mobile, iOS (Objective-C, Swift), and Android (Java, Kotlin). I am mainly an Android developer, and I do basic web programming just for personal purposes. You can have a look at my last projects from [here](/allprojects).

In 2010, I earned my B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering, followed by the completion of my M.Sc. degree in 2012, both from the [University of Kashan](https://kashanu.ac.ir/en). Subsequently, I attained my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2017 from [Shahrood University of Technology (SUT)](http://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/).

Since September 2018, I served as an assistant professor at [Shahrood University of Technology (SUT)](http://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/) for around two years. During this time, I found myself reevaluating my professional goals, eventually leading me to embark on a new journey with [Tomorrow Bank](http://tomorrow.one/). The company's compelling mission and vision resonated with me, aligning with my desire to contribute to a better tomorrow for everyone. After dedicating three years to this meaningful pursuit, I eagerly transitioned to the next chapter of my career at [Wolt enterprise](https://wolt.com/).
