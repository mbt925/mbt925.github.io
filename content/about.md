My name is **Mohsen Biglari** or **محسن بیگلری** in Persian. I am Iranian, and if you want to know exactly where, I am from Galugah (گلوگاه), [Babol, Mazandaran](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babol). I am <span id="age"> years, day(s) and second(s)</span> old.

My favorite sports are soccer and swimming. Throughout my journey from elementary school to high school, I consistently participated in the soccer teams of my educational institutions. However, as life has progressed, carving out time for a team sport has become a more formidable challenge than in my earlier years.

I am in love with animals, especially birds and fish. It might seem unusual, but I've actually gained some hands-on experience as a stockman, albeit on a small scale. During my younger years, I had the pleasure of caring for and raising various mammals such as sheep, cows, and goats, as well as tending to a diverse array of birds and fish. Ah, good old days!

I love programming, and I have some experiences with some programming languages like VB6, C, C++, Java, C#\.Net, VB.Net, MATLAB, Python, Java Mobile, iOS (Objective-C, Swift), and Android (Java, Kotlin). I am mainly an Android developer, and I do basic web programming just for personal purposes. You can have a look at my last projects from [here](/allprojects).

In 2010, I earned my B.Sc. degree in Software Engineering, followed by the completion of my M.Sc. degree in 2012, both from the [University of Kashan](https://kashanu.ac.ir/en). Subsequently, I attained my Ph.D. in Computer Science in 2017 from [Shahrood University of Technology (SUT)](http://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/).

Since September 2018, I served as an assistant professor at [Shahrood University of Technology (SUT)](http://shahroodut.ac.ir/en/) for almost two years. During this time, I found myself reevaluating my professional goals, eventually leading me to embark on a new journey with [Tomorrow Bank](http://tomorrow.one/). The company's compelling mission and vision resonated with me, aligning with my desire to contribute to a better tomorrow for everyone. After dedicating three years to this meaningful pursuit, I eagerly transitioned to the next chapter of my career at [Wolt enterprise](https://wolt.com/).
